# Mai-Khola-Flood-prediction
This repository is based in the LSTM machine learning model where prediction of a flood  of a particular river (khola) is done by the help of rainfall data of five different places .Predicting Floods Using LSTM with Rainfall Data:

Data Collection:

Gather rainfall data from five places.
Handle missing values and standardize the data.
Feature Engineering:

Create lag features (previous days' rainfall).
LSTM Model:

Design an LSTM architecture suitable for time series data.
Train the model using past data.
Validate and test the model's accuracy.
Deployment:

Use the trained model to predict potential flood events based on new rainfall data.
